# Change log is machine readable and very touchy about spaces, use the
# following to initialize debian/changelog.
#
dch --create -v 1.0-1 --package hithere

#
# Version needs to be set in the changelog and in the control file.  Seems odd.
#
# Show info about a particular installed package
#
apt-cache show debhelper

#
# Build things.
#
debuild -us -uc --prepend-path=/opt/go/bin
#
# debuild normally overwrites the path variable.  -ePATH is supposed to
# retain the path but does not seem to work. Use prepend-path instead
# The default path is /usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11
#

Install/de-install scripts are 'debian/p*'.
#
# Install
#
dpkg -i debout/link-share*.deb
#
# Remove -  module name we were defined with. I think established by dch?
#
dpkg -r rua

# Script command lines for various invocations of dpkg.
#
dpkg -i link-share*deb
dpkg -r link-share 

# upgrade 
dpkg -i link-share*deb
